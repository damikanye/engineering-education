The internet is a vast place, and most people don't know how to protect information about themselves. We are part of a generation that generates information every millisecond. We produce more information than we can grasp, so we underestimate the quantity & value of protecting it. 

The good news? You need not be a cybersecurity expert to protect yourself from this kind of threat. We will learn more about cybersecurity and how to help defend ourselves against cyber threats.

## Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the protection of hardware, software, and data from cyberattacks. It ensures integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Cybersecurity is not complicated, it is complex. But it is also very important to understand.

## Benefits of Cybersecurity

- Prevention of unauthorized users
- Prevention of ransomware
- Protection of data & networks
- Protects personal info
- Prevents Spyware
- Prevents Adware

## Types of Cybersecurity

- Network Security: Securing a computer network to prevent threats from illegal intrusion including malicious insiders.
- Application Security: Securing software and hardware to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Data Loss Prevention: Developing policies that prevent the loss of data in the event of a security breach.
- Cloud Security: Protection of data using cloud services by designing new security tools to help secure the data.
- End-User Education: Teaching users how to be security conscious like deleting suspicious mail attachment, not clicking unknown links- which could let in malicious malware.

## Categories Of Cyber Attacks/ Threats

Before looking into the different types of attacks. I want to categorize these cyber threats into three categories:

- Attacks on Confidentiality: This begins with the stealing of personal information. These attacks include stealing bank account details, credit card fraud, stealing login details, etc.
- Attacks on Availability: This is a type of attack where users are denied access to their data until a ransom is paid. 
- Attacks on Integrity: Also known as a sabotage attack, in this attack a cybercriminal access sensitive information and leaks it out to the public. This attack damages and destroys a person or organization.

## Types of Cyber Threats
Cybercriminals use various means to perform their malicious activities.

- Social Engineering: This is the process of manipulating people to give out their confidential information. It's an attack on confidentiality. It comes in various forms; often, it is through a Phishing attack- this is a form of sending a deceitful email intending to steal sensitive information.
- Malware: Malware is a very dangerous software, which includes ransomware and virus. Once it gains access to your system, it causes havoc, ranging from monitoring your online actions, controlling your machine, and monitoring your keystrokes to steal sensitive information from you. It's an attack on availability.
- SQL Injection: With your little computer knowledge, you know that we use SQL (structured query language) to communicate with databases. These databases are essential for storing relevant information. This attack focuses on the SQL database and reveals sensitive. It's an attack on integrity. 

Other cyber attacks include [Denial- of- service](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/denial-of-service/), [Man-in-the-Middle attack](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/man-in-the-middle-attack/), Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), etc.

## Cybersafety tips - protect yourself from cyberattacks

- Use Complex passwords and change them occasionally.
- Install Antivirus
- Install Anti-Malware and antispyware programs
- Perform periodic system backup
- Install Firewall: The word firewall is thrown around the internet, but so many people don't know how they work or what they mean. The growth of the internet made them vital to protecting computers. The primary use for a firewall is simple: Keep the bad guys out.
- Be careful with your email: Cybercriminals can take advantage of your emails in various ways. They can attach viruses in your email, which is triggered when you open the attached file. Importantly, only read or open emails from people you know. If the email sent to you isn’t recognized, try to delete it immediately.
- Do not open email attachments from unknown senders
- Be cautious when using the internet
- Avoid using unsecured WiFi networks in public places
- Use only trusted sites, especially sites with https://, the "s" means is a secured site. 

## Conclusion
We have to leverage cybersecurity to create better lives. The average person deals and conducts transactions online without fully understanding how and what they're doing. Cybersecurity is like the brakes on a car. It doesn’t stop you from where you’re going; it allows you to control the way there.
